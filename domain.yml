  utter_bias_variance:
  - text: "- Bias is error due to erroneous or overly simplistic assumptions in\n\
      \  the learning algorithm you’re using. This can lead to the model underfitting\n\
      \  your data, making it hard for it to have high predictive accuracy and for\
      \ you\n  to generalize your knowledge from the training set to the test set.\
      \ \n- Variance is error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm\
      \ you’re\n  using. This leads to the algorithm being highly sensitive to high\
      \ degrees of\n  variation in your training data, which can lead your model to\
      \ overfit the data.\n  You’ll be carrying too much noise from your training\
      \ data for your model to\n  be very useful for your test data.\n- The bias-variance\
      \ decomposition essentially decomposes the learning error from \n  any algorithm\
      \ by adding the bias, the variance\n  and a bit of irreducible error due to\
      \ noise in the underlying dataset.\n- Essentially, if you make the model more\
      \ complex and add more variables, you’ll\n  lose bias but gain some variance\
      \ — in order to get the optimally reduced amount\n  of error, you’ll have to\
      \ tradeoff bias and variance. You don’t want either high\n  bias or high variance\
      \ in your model.\n"
  utter_supervised_unsupervised:
  - text: Supervised learning requires training labeled data. For example, in order
      to do classification (a supervised learning task), you’ll need to first label
      the data you’ll use to train the model to classify data into your labeled groups.
      Unsupervised learning, in contrast, does not require labeling data explicitly.
